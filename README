 == NOTES ==

* Do NOT commit any xcode/Visual Studio/name your IDE's project files. (please ?)

== CONFIGURATION ==

Linux :

$ mkdir -p Builds/linux-x86
$ cd Builds/linux-x86
$ cmake ../..
$ make

NB: the name of the directory/subdir (Builds/linux-x86) is not really important
    but if it starts with "Builds" it will be ignored by mercurial. (cf .hgignore)
    This is very useful to avoid an accidental commit of all the stuff/crap
    generated when compiling/cmaking/xcoding/...

You can then configure an IDE (netbeans, eclipse,...) or use vim, emacs,... as you wish

MacOSX :

$ mkdir -p Builds/darwin-x86
$ cd Builds/darwin-x86
$ cmake ../..

This should (not tested yet) generate an xcode project. 


Windows :

for the moment the project will not compile on Windows (notably because of pthread, but not only)
however I suppose it might compile just fine with cygwin

When there is a Windows version available, cmake should generate a Visual Project 
suitable for any version of the Visual Studio.
