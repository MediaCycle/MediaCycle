Please extract your own openFrameWorks distribution from http://www.openframeworks.cc in this folder, so that the following missing files and folders will appear in .../demos/openFrameworks:
  addons
  apps
  libs
  other
  readme.txt
  scripts
  xcode templates

All these are filtered out from the MediaCycle mercurial repository, as well as all "bin" and "build" folders from each project contained in .../demos/openFrameworks/numediart/*/*/ (for example .../demos/openFrameworks/numediart/LoopJam/interactiveFloor).
