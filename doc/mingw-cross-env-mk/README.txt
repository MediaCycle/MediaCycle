These are additional makefiles and patches for the mingw-cross-env project (http://www.nongnu.org/mingw-cross-env/) that allows to cross-compile dependencies for win32 from unix hosts (OSX and ubuntu for instance).

Put these files into the src folder of mingw-cross-env if they don't exist already (for more up to date versions).
