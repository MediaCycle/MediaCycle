It's forked from the open-sourced Windows version available originally from the SVN repository at openal.org. OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers, and audio capture.} categories {audio devel} version 1.14 revision 0

It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the source code as an array of argtable structs. The parsing itself is done using GNU getopt and so is 100% GNU compatible.} license unknown maintainers {waqar openmaintainer} categories devel version 2.13 revision 1

It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec library. The project is made of several components: ffmpeg is a command line tool to convert one video file format to another. It also supports grabbing and encoding in real time from a TV card. ffserver is an HTTP (RTSP is being developped) multimedia streaming server for live broadcasts. Time shifting of live broadcast is also supported. ffplay is a simple media player based on SDL and on the ffmpeg libraries. ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion. libavcodec is a library containing all the ffmpeg audio/video encoders and decoders. Most codecs were developped from scratch to ensure best performances and high code reusability. libavformat is a library containing parsers and generators for all common audio/video formats.} categories multimedia version 0.10.4 revision 0
