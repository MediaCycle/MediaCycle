long_description                OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, \
				software implementation of the OpenAL 3D audio API. \
				It's forked from the open-sourced Windows version \
				available originally from the SVN repository at openal.org. \
				OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio \
				in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, \
				doppler shift, and directional sound emitters \
				are among the features handled by the API. \
				More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, \
				and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension. \
				It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel \
				buffers, and audio capture.
