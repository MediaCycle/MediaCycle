description             C++ library of algorithms to extract features \
                        from audio files, including Python bindings.

long_description        Essentia is an open-source C++ library for audio analysis \
                        and audio-based music information retrieval released under \
                        the Affero GPL license. It contains an extensive collection \
                        of reusable algorithms which implement audio input/output \
                        functionality, standard digital signal processing blocks, \
                        statistical characterization of data, and a large set of \
                        spectral, temporal, tonal and high-level music descriptors. \
                        The library is also wrapped in Python and includes a number \
                        of predefined executable extractors for the available music \
                        descriptors, which facilitates its use for fast prototyping \
                        and allows setting up research experiments very rapidly. \
                        Furthermore, it includes a Vamp plugin to be used with \
                        Sonic Visualiser for visualization purposes. The library \
                        is cross-platform and currently supports Linux, Mac OS X, \
                        and Windows systems. Essentia is designed with a focus on \
                        the robustness of the provided music descriptors and is \
                        optimized in terms of the computational cost of the algorithms. \
                        The provided functionality, specifically the music descriptors \
                        included in-the-box and signal processing algorithms, \
                        is easily expandable and allows for both research experiments \
                        and development of large-scale industrial applications.
