History
-------

17.03.2012:
	KinectLogger:
		Added support for variable frame rate videos (-vfr option) and setting a limit to the video encoding buffer (-vmaxbuf option)

15.03.2012:
	KinectLogger:
		Added threaded video encoding with backlog - addresses problem when the computer can't keep up with video encoding, at the expense of using more RAM
		Check the "backlog" indication in the app status bar to see how many frames haven't yet been encoded. 
		When the user closes the app, it will encoded the backlog of frames. Thus the app may take some time before closing to complete the encoding.
    
		Added new APIs to the QtKinectWrapper: getCameraDepthBodies, getCameraDepth.

21.09.2011:
  KinectLogger:
    Added option to create a video containing the depth map and camera image. Relies on QtFFmpegWrapper (http://code.google.com/p/qtffmpegwrapper/)

19.09.2011:
	KinectLogger:
