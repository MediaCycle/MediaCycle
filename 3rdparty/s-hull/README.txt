Included in this distribution are binary versions of s-hull-pro
the more robust and accurate version of s-hull.
Comand line binaries are included for Windows, Mac and Linux.
The main differences between the pro and the beerware versions 
are:
1)  the pro version checks for duplicate points and 
2) includes a more accurate triangle flipping step 
based on the Cline-Renka test.
3) development debug statements have been removed.
4) the code does not leak memory when tested under Valgrind

If you intend to use s-hull commercially we would recommend 
buying the pro version from 
http://www.s-hull.org/index_files/commercial.html

Duplicate points will crash s-hull, but not s-hull-pro

Feedback on the commercial version is welcome david@s-hull.org
